jquery.timeoday
===============

A lightweight and flexible plugin for selecting times for input in a text field. The intention of which is to mimic Google Calendar's implementation of time select fields.

Google Calendar features a select dropdown when you click upon the text field that allows you to select a time with the mouse pointer rather than having to enter numbers with keys. After surveying multiple options, this seems to be a the least worst interaction pattern.
